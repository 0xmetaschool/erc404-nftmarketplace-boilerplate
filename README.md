# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install dotenv --save --force
npm install --save-dev hardhat --force
npm install --force
```

Try running some of the following tasks to test your project:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
